# Minimal GitHub Pages Portfolio

A lightweight starter for a personal portfolio. The UI is still a simple "Hello World", but the remaining folders focus entirely on visuals and assets you'll grow over time.

## What's Inside Now

```
root
├── index.html          # Temporary landing page
├── src/                # Styles, scripts, and future components
│   ├── assets/         # Images, icons, fonts, videos
│   ├── styles/         # global/base/layout/theme CSS
│   └── scripts/        # Vanilla JS + modules
├── public/             # Files copied directly to the site root
├── LICENSE             # MIT by default
├── README.md           # You are here
└── .gitignore          # Keeps builds and OS cruft out of git
```

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)

1. Commit this repo and push it to GitHub.
2. Open **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from branch**, and select `main` + `/root`.
3. Edit `index.html`, `src/styles/main.css`, and `src/scripts/main.js` to reflect your real portfolio story.

## Next Design-Focused Steps

- Flesh out sections under `src/sections/` and components under `src/components/` as layouts emerge.
- Drop hero/preview assets into `src/assets/` and reference them from the HTML.
- Add a bundler or static-site generator later if the project outgrows this simple setup.

Happy building! 🚀
